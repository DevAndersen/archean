# Archean

Archean aims to be a modern and highly flexible Minecraft Classic server, targeting [version 0.30 of the game](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Classic_0.30).

The project is named after [the Archean Eon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean), an early period in Earth's history, mirroring the version of the game that this project targets.

This project was made possible thanks to the technical documentation of the Minecraft Classic Protocol, provided on [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Classic_Protocol) and the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Classic_server_protocol).
